            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I have been a practitioner in digital humanities with over 20
            years experience in software development, web design and
            development, digital archives and collections, digital storytelling,
            and community building + support. Projects I have contributed to include
            THATCamp, Omeka, Zotero, Neatline, Prism, the Praxis Program, and
            Speaking in Code. I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses
            on U.S. history, creating history with new media, introduction to
            digital history, digital american studies, and digital archives +
            social justice.</p>

            <p>My current research and teaching interests include adaptations of
            fiction and nonfiction works for table top role playing games (e.g.
            Dungeons and Dragons), a working library for digital humanities
            consults/collaborations, and explorations in reparative
            archival/collections work.</p>
