# Jeremy Boggs

Head of Research & Development
Scholars’ Lab
University of Virginia Library


## About Me

I have been a practitioner in digital humanities with over 20
years experience in software development, web design and
development, digital archives and collections, digital storytelling,
and community building + support. Projects I have contributed to include
THATCamp, Omeka, Zotero, Neatline, Prism, the Praxis Program, and
Speaking in Code. I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses
on U.S. history, creating history with new media, introduction to
digital history, digital american studies, and digital archives +
social justice.

My current research and teaching interests include adaptations of
fiction and nonfiction works for table top role playing games (e.g.
Dungeons and Dragons), a working library for digital humanities
consults/collaborations, and explorations in reparative
archival/collections work.

## Selected Projects

### 5e Jekyll Theme

A modest theme for the Jekyll static site builder that emulates the aesthetic of
the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons.

### Speaking in Code

[![](/images/speaking-in-code.jpg)](https://codespeak.scholarslab.org)

Branding, web design + development, and organizational
planning for Speaking in Code, a two-day symposium to give voice
to the tacit intellectual work of DH designers and developers.
