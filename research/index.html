        <h3>Dissertation Theme</h3>
        <p>My disseration examines the economic modernization and urban development within the American South in the post-World War II era. Often, early scholarship of urban America focused on northern cities like New York, Chicago, and Detroit while focusing on the theme of suburbanization, deindustralization and the decline and destabilization of these cities. However, the rise of cities in the American South and West like Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, and others complicate these traditional narratives of urban decline. Since the 1950s, the South and West would experience significant economic and population growth that would transform the region both economically and politically. In focusing on the South, rising cities in the postwar era featured rapid growth, sprawling landscapes, new immigration, diversified economies, heavy federal investment, as well as the continued existence of racial inequality.</p>
            
        <h3>Why Orlando</h3>
        <p>In examining the themes of economic modernization and urban development, my disseration will present the Greater Orlando, Florida area as a bellwether to understand developments in urban America both in the transformation of the urban landscape and its impact on the lived realities of the local populace. Most people associate the rise of Orlando with the arrival of Disney World in 1971. Yet, while affirming both Disney's beneficial and determintal impacts on the area, my disseration seeks to provide a counterpoint to the true origins of the birth of modern Orlando that emerged before the arrival and Disney and then note the role of Disney and the tourism and service industry in accelerating the region's growth and axacerbating the region's inequalities.</p>
