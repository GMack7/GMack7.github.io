        <h3>Scholarly Intervention</h3>
        <p>My disseration examines the economic modernization and urban development within the American South in the post-World War II era. Since the 1950s, major cities in the South, and also the West, experienced significant economic and population growth that would transform the region both economically and politically. In focusing on the South, rising cities in the postwar era featured rapid growth, sprawling landscapes, new immigration, diversified economies, heavy federal investment, as well as the continued existence of racial inequality. These dynamics are associated with the rise of the Sunbelt across the South and West. My area of focus for my disseration will be on the Greater Orlando, Florida metropolitan area from 1940 to 1980. </p>

        <h3>Why Orlando</h3>
        <p>In examining the themes of economic modernization and urban development in the mid-twentieth century, my disseration will present the Orlando area as a bellwether to understand developments in urban America both in the transformation of the urban landscape and its impact on the lived realities of the local populace.</p>

        <p>Most people associate the rise of Orlando with the arrival of Disney World in 1971. Yet, while affirming both Disney's beneficial and determintal impacts on the area, my disseration seeks to provide a counterpoint to the true origins of the birth of modern Orlando that emerged before the arrival and Disney and then note the role of Disney and the tourism and service industry in accelerating the region's growth and axacerbating the region's inequalities.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Central Question</h3>
        <p>In 1931, Orlando had a modest population of around 35,000 as the region's economy largely depended on local tourism and agriculture, particularly the citrus industry. So how did Orlando go from being a sleepy citrus town in the 1930s to become the “Action Center of Florida” by the 1960s and the fastest growing city in Florida, even before the arrival of Disney?</p>
        <h4>Geography</h4>
        <p>Orlando benefited from its geographic location within Florida and the South. During World War II and its aftermath, the South became attractive to the US military and the defense industry due to the region's surplus of undeveloped land and the belief that uplifting the region would trickle down to the local populace, resulting in thousands of soldiers, veterans, high-skill workers and their families migrated to the area. During this era, Orlando served as a home base for the US Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. In 1958, the Glenn L. Company, the predecessor to the current Lochheed Martin Corporation, opened an Orlando Division. Orlando also benefited from being the largest major city to Cape Canaveral on Florida's east-central coast used for ballistic missile testing and space exploration.</p>
